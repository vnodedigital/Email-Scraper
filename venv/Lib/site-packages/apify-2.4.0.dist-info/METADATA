              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

# Apify SDK for Python

The Apify SDK for Python is the official library to create [Apify Actors](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors)
in Python. It provides useful features like Actor lifecycle management, local storage emulation, and Actor
event handling.

If you just need to access the [Apify API](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2) from your Python applications,
check out the [Apify Client for Python](https://docs.apify.com/api/client/python) instead.

## Installation

The Apify SDK for Python is available on PyPI as the `apify` package.
For default installation, using Pip, run the following:

```bash
pip install apify
```

For users interested in integrating Apify with Scrapy, we provide a package extra called `scrapy`.
To install Apify with the `scrapy` extra, use the following command:

```bash
pip install apify[scrapy]
```

## Documentation

For usage instructions, check the documentation on [Apify Docs](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/).

## Examples

Below are few examples demonstrating how to use the Apify SDK with some web scraping-related libraries.

### Apify SDK with HTTPX and BeautifulSoup

This example illustrates how to integrate the Apify SDK with [HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/) and [BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) to scrape data from web pages.

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from httpx import AsyncClient

from apify import Actor


async def main() -> None:
    async with Actor:
        # Retrieve the Actor input, and use default values if not provided.
        actor_input = await Actor.get_input() or {}
        start_urls = actor_input.get('start_urls', [{'url': 'https://apify.com'}])

        # Open the default request queue for handling URLs to be processed.
        request_queue = await Actor.open_request_queue()

        # Enqueue the start URLs.
        for start_url in start_urls:
            url = start_url.get('url')
            await request_queue.add_request(url)

        # Process the URLs from the request queue.
        while request := await request_queue.fetch_next_request():
            Actor.log.info(f'Scraping {request.url} ...')

            # Fetch the HTTP response from the specified URL using HTTPX.
            async with AsyncClient() as client:
                response = await client.get(request.url)

            # Parse the HTML content using Beautiful Soup.
            soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

            # Extract the desired data.
            data = {
                'url': actor_input['url'],
                'title': soup.title.string,
                'h1s': [h1.text for h1 in soup.find_all('h1')],
                'h2s': [h2.text for h2 in soup.find_all('h2')],
                'h3s': [h3.text for h3 in soup.find_all('h3')],
            }

            # Store the extracted data to the default dataset.
            await Actor.push_data(data)
```

### Apify SDK with PlaywrightCrawler from Crawlee

This example demonstrates how to use the Apify SDK alongside `PlaywrightCrawler` from [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev/python) to perform web scraping.

```python
from crawlee.crawlers import PlaywrightCrawler, PlaywrightCrawlingContext

from apify import Actor


async def main() -> None:
    async with Actor:
        # Retrieve the Actor input, and use default values if not provided.
        actor_input = await Actor.get_input() or {}
        start_urls = [url.get('url') for url in actor_input.get('start_urls', [{'url': 'https://apify.com'}])]

        # Exit if no start URLs are provided.
        if not start_urls:
            Actor.log.info('No start URLs specified in Actor input, exiting...')
            await Actor.exit()

        # Create a crawler.
        crawler = PlaywrightCrawler(
            # Limit the crawl to max requests. Remove or increase it for crawling all links.
            max_requests_per_crawl=50,
            headless=True,
        )

        # Define a request handler, which will be called for every request.
        @crawler.router.default_handler
        async def request_handler(context: PlaywrightCrawlingContext) -> None:
            url = context.request.url
            Actor.log.info(f'Scraping {url}...')

            # Extract the desired data.
            data = {
                'url': context.request.url,
                'title': await context.page.title(),
                'h1s': [await h1.text_content() for h1 in await context.page.locator('h1').all()],
                'h2s': [await h2.text_content() for h2 in await context.page.locator('h2').all()],
                'h3s': [await h3.text_content() for h3 in await context.page.locator('h3').all()],
            }

            # Store the extracted data to the default dataset.
            await context.push_data(data)

            # Enqueue additional links found on the current page.
            await context.enqueue_links()

        # Run the crawler with the starting URLs.
        await crawler.run(start_urls)
```

## What are Actors?

Actors are serverless cloud programs that can do almost anything a human can do in a web browser.
They can do anything from small tasks such as filling in forms or unsubscribing from online services,
all the way up to scraping and processing vast numbers of web pages.

They can be run either locally, or on the [Apify platform](https://docs.apify.com/platform/),
where you can run them at scale, monitor them, schedule them, or publish and monetize them.

If you're new to Apify, learn [what is Apify](https://docs.apify.com/platform/about)
in the Apify platform documentation.

## Creating Actors

To create and run Actors through Apify Console,
see the [Console documentation](https://docs.apify.com/academy/getting-started/creating-actors#choose-your-template).

To create and run Python Actors locally, check the documentation for
[how to create and run Python Actors locally](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/docs/overview/running-locally).
