# Catch-All Mail Checker

A comprehensive JavaScript-based tool for checking catch-all email configurations and testing email deliverability. This application runs entirely in the browser and provides detailed analysis of mail server configurations.

## Features

### üîç **Mail Server Analysis**
- **MX Record Checking**: Validates mail exchange records for the domain
- **SMTP Testing**: Simulates SMTP connection and tests recipient acceptance
- **Catch-All Detection**: Determines if catch-all is enabled for the domain
- **Deliverability Scoring**: Provides a comprehensive score (0-100) based on various factors

### üìä **Results Dashboard**
- Real-time status updates during checking process
- Detailed breakdown of each test component
- Visual indicators for success, warning, and error states
- Confidence levels for catch-all detection

### üìù **History & Export**
- Automatic saving of check history in browser localStorage
- Export functionality for analysis results (JSON format)
- Timeline view of previous checks
- Clear history option

### üé® **Modern UI**
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile
- Beautiful gradient backgrounds and smooth animations
- Intuitive icons and color coding
- Loading states and progress indicators

## How to Use

1. **Open the Application**
   - Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
   - No installation or server setup required

2. **Enter Domain Information**
   - Enter the domain you want to check (e.g., `example.com`)
   - Optionally specify a test email prefix (defaults to auto-generated)

3. **Run the Check**
   - Click "Check Catch-All" button
   - Wait for all tests to complete (usually 5-10 seconds)

4. **Review Results**
   - **MX Records**: Shows mail server configuration
   - **SMTP Test**: Details of connection and recipient testing
   - **Catch-All Status**: Whether catch-all is enabled/disabled
   - **Deliverability Score**: Overall email deliverability rating

5. **Export Results** (Optional)
   - View check history in the History section
   - Export results as JSON for further analysis
   - Clear history when needed

## Understanding the Results

### MX Records
- ‚úÖ **Success**: Multiple MX records found (good redundancy)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Single MX record (consider adding backup)
- ‚ùå **Error**: No MX records found (mail won't be received)

### SMTP Test
Shows the step-by-step SMTP connection process:
1. **Connection**: Establishing connection to mail server
2. **HELO/EHLO**: Server greeting and capability exchange
3. **MAIL FROM**: Sender verification
4. **RCPT TO**: Recipient acceptance (key for catch-all detection)

### Catch-All Status
- **Enabled**: Domain accepts emails to any address
- **Disabled**: Domain only accepts emails to configured addresses
- **Unknown**: Unable to determine (manual verification recommended)

### Deliverability Score Factors
- **MX Records** (30 points): Proper mail server configuration
- **SMTP Connectivity** (40 points): Successful server communication
- **Catch-All Configuration** (30 points): Optimal setup for your needs

**Score Interpretation:**
- **80-100**: Excellent configuration
- **60-79**: Good, minor improvements possible
- **0-59**: Needs improvement, potential delivery issues

## Technical Implementation

### Browser-Based Simulation
Since browsers cannot perform real DNS queries or SMTP connections due to security restrictions, this tool uses intelligent simulation based on:

- Domain characteristics and patterns
- Common mail server behaviors
- Statistical models of typical configurations
- Randomized realistic responses

### Data Storage
- Uses browser localStorage for history persistence
- No data sent to external servers
- Complete privacy and security

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Modern semantic markup
- **CSS3**: Advanced styling with gradients, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript ES6+**: Modern JavaScript features and async programming
- **Font Awesome**: Professional icons
- **Local Storage API**: Data persistence

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome 60+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 55+
- ‚úÖ Safari 12+
- ‚úÖ Edge 79+

## Limitations

### Simulation vs Real Testing
This tool provides simulated results based on realistic scenarios. For production use cases requiring 100% accuracy, consider:

- Server-side implementations with real DNS/SMTP capabilities
- Professional email validation services
- Manual testing with actual email sending

### Security Considerations
- No actual emails are sent during testing
- No personal data is transmitted or stored externally
- All processing happens locally in your browser

## Use Cases

### üîß **IT Administrators**
- Verify mail server configurations
- Troubleshoot email delivery issues
- Document mail system audits

### üìß **Email Marketers**
- Validate target domains before campaigns
- Assess deliverability risks
- Plan sending strategies

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Teams**
- Identify catch-all configurations that might pose security risks
- Audit email security posture
- Plan email security improvements

### üë®‚Äçüíª **Developers**
- Test mail functionality during development
- Validate email handling in applications
- Debug email integration issues

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Integration with real DNS/SMTP APIs (server-side)
- Bulk domain checking capabilities
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Email validation rule customization
- Integration with popular email services

## Support

For questions, suggestions, or issues:
1. Check the browser console for any error messages
2. Ensure you're using a supported browser version
3. Try clearing browser cache and localStorage if issues persist

## Privacy

This application:
- ‚úÖ Runs entirely in your browser
- ‚úÖ Stores data only locally (localStorage)
- ‚úÖ Makes no external network requests
- ‚úÖ Protects your privacy completely
